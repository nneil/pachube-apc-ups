You need to install the APC monitoring package for your distribution. On
ubuntu use:

apt-get install apcupsd

Put your api key and feed id into two files called

apikey
feedid

(Or you can put them into the variable assignments in the program).

Run apc.pl from cron every 10 minutes or so to update your feed.
